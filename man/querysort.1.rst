------------------------------------
RFC 1866 querystring sorting library
------------------------------------

:Version: 1.1.0
:Manual section: 1

SYNOPSIS
========

| **querysort** [-nv] *URI*
  **querysort** [-dnv] [-f *FILE*]
  **querysort** --version
  **querysort** --help

DESCRIPTION
===========

Sort the fields of an URI's querystring in compliance with the RFC 1866. The RFC
3986 defines the form of a URI, but not the form of a URI's query. What
QuerySort sorts is the fields of an \`application/x-www-form-urlencoded' query,
a form, as defined in HTML 2.0 RFC 1866. Any other part of the URI is kept
untouched.

It is a common case that the fields order of a query string is not relevant.
What usually matter is the key/value aspect of the query, and therefore the
values of the keys. If you manipulate URLs, a query and its fields permutations
might actually point to the same resource.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

**\-d**,
**--delimiter**\=\ *DELIM*

 use *DELIM* instead of EOL for field delimiter

**\-f**,
**--file**\=\ *FILE*

 read URIs from *FILE*

**-n**, **--no-clean**

 do not discard empty parameters in URIs

**-v**, **--verbose**

 provide more detailed information

| 
| You can use a delimiter only when reading URIs from a file.
  With no URI, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

EXAMPLES
========

You can use querysort in two modes, the first one sorts a single URI from the
command line, the other one sorts a batch of URIs from a file.

Using the command line
----------------------

| $ **querysort** *'localhost/?some=thing&an=other'*
  localhost/?an=other&some=thing

| $ **querysort** *localhost/?*
  localhost/?

| $ **querysort** *'localhost/?some=thing&an=other#fragment'*
  localhost/?an=other&some=thing#fragment

Reading from a file
-------------------

You can for instance read a URI from the standard input.

| 
| $ **echo** *'localhost/?some=thing&an=other'* | **querysort**
  localhost/?an=other&some=thing

It is also possible to read multiple URIs from a file, the default delimiter is
the **EOL** character.

| 
| $ **echo** -e *'localhost/?a&b\\nlocalhost/?b&a'* | **querysort**
  localhost/?a&b
  localhost/?a&b
