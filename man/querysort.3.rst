RFC 1866 querystring sorting library
------------------------------------

:Version: 1.1.0
:Manual section: 3

SYNOPSIS
========

::

    #include <querysort.h>

    enum {
        QS_OK,
        QS_ERROR,
        QS_CLEANED
    };

    char * qs_version();

    char * qs_sort_copy(const char*);

    int qs_sort(const char*, char*);
    int qs_sort_clean(const char*, char*);

    int qs_fsort(const char*, FILE*);
    int qs_fsort_clean(const char*, FILE*);

DESCRIPTION
===========

This page summarizes the functions provided by the querysort library.

char \* qs_version()
--------------------

Returns the current version of the library.

char \* qs_sort_copy(const char \*url)
--------------------------------------

Create a copy of the given *url* with its querystring sorted. The URI is assumed
to be valid. If the URI doesn't have a querystring, a simple copy is returned.

A returned non-NULL URI must be freed by the caller.

int qs_sort(const char \*url, char \*destination)
-------------------------------------------------

Writes the given *url* with its querystring sorted to the *destination*. The URI
is assumed to be valid. If the URI doesn't have a querystring, a simple copy is
made.


int qs_sort_clean(const char \*url, char \*destination)
-------------------------------------------------------

Writes the given *url* with its querystring sorted to the *destination*. The URI
is assumed to be valid. If the URI doesn't have a querystring, a simple copy is
made. This function discards empty parameters in the querystring, if any.

int qs_fsort(const char \*url, FILE \*stream)
---------------------------------------------

Writes the given *url* with its querystring sorted to the *stream*. The URI is
assumed to be valid. If the URI doesn't have a querystring, a simple copy is
made.


int qs_fsort_clean(const char \*url, FILE \*stream)
---------------------------------------------------

Writes the given *url* with its querystring sorted to the *stream*. The URI is
assumed to be valid. If the URI doesn't have a querystring, a simple copy is
made. This function discards empty parameters in the querystring, if any.

RETURN VALUE
============

| Functions that return pointers return **NULL** on error, and set errno to the corresponding error-code returned by functions returning an integer.
  Functions that return an integer return one of the following error codes:

QS_OK
-----
    The function succeeded.

QS_ERROR
--------
    An error occurred (see errno).

QS_CLEANED
----------
    The function succeeded but empty parameters where removed.

EXAMPLES
========

Basic invocation
----------------

::

    char *sorted_url = qs_sort_copy("http://localhost/?some=thing&an=other");
    if (sorted_url != NULL) {
        puts(sorted_url);
        free(sorted_url);
    }

Write to a file
---------------

::

    qs_fsort("http://localhost/?some=thing&an=other", stdout);
