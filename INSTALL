Installation Instructions
=========================

Autotools
---------

QuerySort uses the autotools suite. To build and install querysort, run the
following commands:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install

On Linux,  you also  need to  run  'ldconfig'  as root afterwards in order to
update the shared library cache.

The QuerySort command line  uses liburiparser for URI validation,  and uriparser
development package is required at build time.

RPM
---

QuerySort can instead be built as RPM packages, run the following commands:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make rpm

This will produce the following packages:
* querysort, the command line utility
* querysort-lib, a shared object
* querysort-devel, resources for developers

Use 'rpm -i' or your favorite RPM-based package manager as root for actual
installation.
