QuerySort
=========

RFC 1866 querystring sorting program and library.

Wat ?
-----

QuerySort's  goal is to sort the  query (or querystring) part of a URI.  The RFC
3986 defines the form of a URI :
 * scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

The query can  actually hold any character,  provided that  the URI is  properly
encoded. So how does QuerySort figure out how the querystring should be sorted ?

RFC  1866 states that  an HTML form,  submited with  the GET method  of the HTTP
protocol  should be  sent via  the querystring.  Now getting to  the point,  the
default encoding of an HTML form is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded',  a list
of key/value fields.

So basically, QuerySort sorts the fields of a querystring.

Usage
-----

$ querysort 'http://localhost/path?some=thing&an=other'
> Prints http://localhost/path?an=other&some=thing

*char sorted_uri = qs_sort_copy("http://localhost/path?some=thing&an=other");

if (sorted_uri != NULL) {
    [...]
    free(sorted_uri);
}

Why ?
-----

It is common that the order of an  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded' fields is
not relevant. In that case, the URIs are not equal, but one could assume they're
equivalent.  You can  use it to  know if  two different  URLs point to  the same
resource for example.
